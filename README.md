The project uses Naive Bayes Classification to help detect the emotion of the review given by the people for a certain movie.
This will help in analysing as to which movie is liked by the people and which is not. The system is trained using a movie dataset 
easily available on net for both positive and negative reviews given by the people. The preprocessing of the review is done when the 
person gives a movie review and the preprocessed review is then tested upon the trained model. The system can be tested by using postman.
The system has shown good results by analysing the review of people as positive or negative correctly.
